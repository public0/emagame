## Current Gameplay
1. One Hero can fight multiple enemies
2. In order to give the hero a fighting chance the hero can attack all enemies on his turn (this can be changed easily if needed in game logic)
3. Heroes and enemies alike can have special offensive/defensive abilities that are used randomly
based on their luck stat (not hardcoded ex. Rapid strike 10% chance) this can be easiliy changed if needed
4. Game ends when either all enemies have 0 hp resulting in a win or hero has 0 hp resulting in a loss
